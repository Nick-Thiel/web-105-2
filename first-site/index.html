   <h1>Meet Nick</h1>
   <p>I'm taking this class for two reasons mainly. The first reason I'm taking this is that it seemed interesting. The second reason is that it's one of the classes I would need to complete my degree.</p>
   <h2>Nick's Hobbies</h2>
   <h3>Reading</h3>

        <p>Something I often end up doing is reading because I tend to find it soothing in a way. Another reason I often end up reading is that it's just way to occupy time for me. In all truth I don't really care if the reading I'm doing is online or using a physical book or something.</p>
   <h3>Gaming</h3>

        <p>Something I'll often end up doing outside of reading is playing various videogames. I'll often end up playing online with various people as well. The games(s) I'll be playing at a time tend to vary quite a lot.</p>
   <h3>Dungeons and Dragons</h3>

        <p>In all honesty I don't fully get why I like doing Dungeons and Dragons or D&D, I just get that I enjoy it. I'm currently playing with one group who I've been with for a few months where we've had various characters die, and I'm going to be joining up with another group next week. My first ever experience with it was back in a club in highschool which I had to leave right after my character in it was petrified.</p>
